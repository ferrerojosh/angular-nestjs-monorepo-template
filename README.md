# Angular NestJS MonoRepo Template

This is a simple mono repo template.

The advantage of this is that you can duplicate some sort of `base` project and create flavors of it. In this case
our `base` is a single Angular + NestJS project.

The current setup does not have tests for now but I will add it on later versions. Preferably using Jest across the
two frameworks.
